## Application Name: AesCryptography ##

* Description: Simple AES encrypt and decrypt example.

* This program is setup as a Nunit test project and a core library.
Just open the 'Test Explorer' and run/debug the tests to exercise encryption/decryption

### Primary Features ###

* AES Encryption
* AES Decryption

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is AES ###

* AES/Rijndael (pronounced “Rhine-doll”)
	* Currently the most widely used symmetric key block cipher for commercial applications.
	* NIST’s recommended replacement for DES.
	* 128, 192 or 256 bit key with 128 bit data block.
	* Runs approximately 6 times faster than triple DES (3DES).
